# Prototypes

It's a collection of my small projects and experiments.

I don't see reason to create a separate repository for every few lines of code I want to test out,
so I decided to put all the small things into a single repository.

If you find something interesting let me know!

Have fun!

## Map of content

- [LinkedIn Pacing](linkedin-pacing) - Comparison of naive implmentations of classic ASAP and proposed by LinkedIn throttled pacing algorithms. For those not from the AdTech industry: a pacing algorithm defines how aggresively an advertising campaign is spending its budget in ad impression auctions.

- [Dagster with Apache Spark](dagster-with-spark) - Example project showcasing usage of Dagster (orchestrator) with Apache Spark (data processing). Apache Spark is one my favourite tools for data processing (Pandas is the other one), but I didn't have too much experience with tasks orchestrators. Apache Airflow didn't stole my heart and I was tempted with the typed input/output control offered by Dagster.

- [Services standalone](services-standalone) - A few scripts setting up some of the services I use for prototypes development.
